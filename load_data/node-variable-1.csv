The value in CPSBMRKS is used in combination with values in CPTEST and CPCELSTA to fully describe the cell population being measured. As such, it is an essential component of the full test name. \n For example, three unnamed sublineages of monocytes have been identified as: CCR2+CD16-, CCR2-CD16+, and CCR2+CD16+. Whereas the entire monocyte cell population can be defined as CD14+ cells, the additional CCR2 and CD16 markers are used to differentiate one sublineage from another. As none of these sublineages have been given names, they are only known by the CCR2 and CD16 marker combinations. By associating the CPTEST value of ""Monocytes Sub"" with, for example, a value of ""CCR2+CD16-"" in CPSBMRKS, the full test is defined to be the CCR2+CD16- monocyte subpopulation.","Char","Variable Qualifier","Perm","","",""
