To ensure nuances important for accurately interpreting the data are accounted for and which arise from the use of different gating strategies, it is often necessary to qualify the test in terms of the gating strategy. For some purposes, however, and at the discretion of the sponsor, only the ultimate or penultimate gate is identified.
