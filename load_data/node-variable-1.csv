For cell phenotyping, the name (often abbreviated) of the cell population, as it is generally accepted by the scientific community, is populated (rather than a colloquial designation based on a primary marker, e.g., TLym Help rather than CD4). When the test is for a sublineage which can only be identified by specifying additional markers (i.e., has not been given a name) or which is further restricted to a subpopulation based on a particular cell state (e.g., activated, proliferating, apoptotic), the Sublineage Marker String (CPSBMRKS), Cell State (CPCELSTA), and Cell State Marker String (CPCSMRKS) variables are additionally populated and the value in CPTEST is suffixed with ""Sub"" to denote that it is a subset of the population identified in CPTEST (e.g., Monocytes Sub). \n The value in CPTEST cannot be longer than 40 characters.","Char","Synonym Qualifier","Req","","C181174","https://ct.d4k.dk/cdisc/dataset/sc/2021-09-24/sdtm/C181174"

Whereas the entire monocyte cell population can be defined as CD14+ cells, the additional CCR2 and CD16 markers are used to differentiate one sublineage from another. As none of these sublineages have been given names, they are only known by the CCR2 and CD16 marker combinations.
